The Horror

100DaysOfCode challenge number 1!

This is my 100DaysOfCode challenge and the code I have been pushing to this repo is HORRIBLE! You should neeeever do this. The thing is that I have pretty much 1 hour a day and I'm going to push the code every single day, so this is what you get. I don't even have a plan for this project, I just write code and push it. Maybe after a week I will abandon this project and start a fresh one? Who knows, we'll just have to wait and see. I hope I will have some time to plan the next project, when ever that starts!
